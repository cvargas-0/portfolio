Building is the easy part. **Knowing what to build is what hurts.**

I’ve spent years jumping between APIs and side projects.  
My natural workflow has always been: _idea → code_. It’s comfortable, it’s tangible, and it gives you a false sense of progress.

But there’s a pit I keep falling into: **the inability to think about the product out loud before writing the first line of code.**

I’m not talking about system architecture. I’m talking about facing the uncomfortable truth:

- Am I solving a real problem, or do I just like the technology I’m about to use?
- What is the minimum that delivers real value today?
- Why should anyone care about this?

When ideas live only in your head, they’re perfect.  
When you try to ground them, they turn into **noise**. And noise is the graveyard of projects that never made it to production.

## The legal void between the idea and the ticket

We have plenty of tools for when the path is already defined.  
If you have a backlog, you have Jira. If you have a plan, you have Notion.

But **what do you have when all you have is doubt?**

That early stage is fragile. There are no frameworks that can save you from the initial chaos, and that’s exactly where most of us give up or worse, build something nobody needs.

**PM-SKILL was created to fill that void.**

## Not an app, but a mental process

PM-SKILL didn’t start on a design board. It started with frustration: current LLMs are great at writing code, but mediocre at challenging your product thinking unless you guide them carefully.

I asked myself: _What if AI could be the sparring partner that forces you to think?_

I don’t want a bot that generates a generic PRD. I want a capability a **skill** that can:

1. **Filter the noise:** Help separate “cool” features from necessary ones.
2. **Challenge the premise:** Ask who would actually feel pain if this project didn’t exist.
3. **Structure the chaos:** Turn a messy note into a testable hypothesis.

## A copilot for Day 0

I like to think of PM-SKILL as that senior colleague who doesn’t give you answers, but asks the questions you’ve been avoiding.

It’s not here to replace a Product Manager. It’s here to **unblock** one. Especially in workflows where there are no assigned tasks, no roadmaps, no tickets. Just you, an AI agent, and an idea waiting to be shaped.

That’s why it’s a **skill**, not a closed platform. It’s designed to live where you already work (agents, terminals, custom assistants), adding a layer of product judgment where there used to be empty prompts.

## Building to think better

PM-SKILL is, today, an honest experiment. It’s small, open, and constantly evolving.

Its goal isn’t perfection it’s **clarity**.  
An invitation to stop shipping for the sake of shipping and start using technology to make better decisions from day one.

If you’ve ever let an idea die because you didn’t know where to start, [PM-SKILL](https://github.com/vrgs-dev/pm-skill) is for you.
