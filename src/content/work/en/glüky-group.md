Backend engineering for digital products in a fully remote environment, focusing on scalable service design, RESTful APIs, and database performance.

Impact highlights

- Designed and shipped RESTful APIs in Node.js with clear domain boundaries, enabling predictable releases and easier maintenance.
- Improved API throughput and p95 latency by ~30% on key endpoints through query optimization, caching, and async I/O tuning.
- Refactored critical flows into smaller services/modules to reduce coupling and simplify feature delivery in a microservices-friendly architecture.
- Strengthened reliability with idempotent handlers, retry-safe integrations, and pragmatic observability (logs + metrics + alert signals).
