First full-time backend role, building production-grade services and RESTful APIs with a strong focus on maintainability, data integrity, and performance.

Core contributions

- Implemented REST APIs in Node.js for internal and customer-facing workflows, standardizing request/response patterns and error handling.
- Modeled relational data and optimized SQL queries (indexes + query planning), reducing slow queries by ~35% and improving endpoint response times.
- Added authentication and access control flows (role-based permissions) to protect sensitive operations and reduce support incidents.
- Improved reliability under concurrency by applying idempotency patterns and safe retries for external service integrations.
