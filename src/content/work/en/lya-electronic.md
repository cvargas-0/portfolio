Led backend development for internal systems and commercial platforms, with emphasis on scalable APIs, database optimization, and resilient service behavior.

Highlights

- Designed RESTful APIs in Node.js with clean separation of concerns, enabling faster iteration on business features without compromising stability.
- Optimized SQL queries and data access patterns (indexes + batching + pagination), improving response times by ~30–45% on high-usage endpoints.
- Implemented robust authentication and authorization flows (role-based access, token lifecycle), reducing security-related regressions.
- Improved concurrency handling for critical operations with idempotency keys, safe retries, and guarded state transitions.
