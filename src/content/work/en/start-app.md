End-to-end delivery for multiple client products, with a strong backend focus on scalable architecture, RESTful APIs, and database performance.

Backend focus and outcomes

- Designed service-oriented backends (Node.js) with clear boundaries and reusable modules, making features easier to ship and maintain.
- Built REST APIs with consistent contracts, validation, and error standards to support multiple frontends and integrations.
- Optimized SQL-heavy endpoints (indexes, pagination, batching) and introduced caching patterns to reduce response times by ~30–40% in critical flows.
- Implemented concurrency-safe processing for background jobs and integrations (idempotency + retries), improving reliability in automation pipelines.
