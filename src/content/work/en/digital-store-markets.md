Built backend foundations for a commerce platform, focusing on API reliability, data consistency, and performance under concurrent workloads.

Key outcomes

- Designed RESTful APIs in Flask for catalog, pricing, and order flows, prioritizing clean contracts and predictable error handling.
- Optimized SQL queries and indexing strategy for high-traffic endpoints, reducing average query time by ~35–45% on critical reads.
- Implemented concurrency-safe operations for inventory and order state transitions (idempotency + optimistic checks) to prevent double-processing.
- Added observability baselines (structured logging + actionable metrics) to speed up incident triage and performance tuning.
